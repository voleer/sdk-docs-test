# What is Voleer?

Getting IT together has never been so easy.

---

We've been in the cloud business since before it became mainstream.
Since then, weâ€™ve seen IT professionals struggle to keep up with ever-growing demands and less resources.
The deployment and management of hundreds of applications using dozens
of tools is inefficient - we recognized that there needed to be a better way.

This is why we created **Voleer**.
A system that centralizes the assessment, deployment, management, and remediation
of IT needs whether it be an on-premise server, SaaS application, IoT device and more.
Our platform can reach across networks and cloud environments to help you manage business
outcomes, not technologies, with a single button. Furthermore, our out-of-the-box automation
allows you to achieve ROI immediately by eliminating the repetitive tasks and improving employee satisfaction.
