## History

Over a decade ago we started building software to help IT services providers drive cloud adoption. Today, our industry-leading platform helps IT professionals assess, deploy, and manage cloud solutions with greater profitability.

### 2007
In 2007, Geeman Yip took a big risk on a small idea: Make software for the cloud.
Geeman had three goals: create the best place to work, offer free cloud storage, and tie cloud-based applications together. It turned out the market wasn’t ready. His products were ahead of their time—so he poured his skills, insights, and industry knowledge into a solution to help people move to the cloud.

### Now

Born and raised in the Seattle area, BitTitan has grown into a global company with employees from all over the world. We have offices in Bellevue and Singapore, as well as teams throughout North America, EMEA, and APAC.

We love learning from the cultures and interests of our teams and the IT services providers we work with around the world. We've proudly helped deploy IT services to organizations in 187 countries across all seven continents—even Antarctica.
